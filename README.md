This is the repository for the effort of rewriting the COLE exploration
framework in Haskell. The main purpose is to be as modular as possible.

The repository contains multiple packages:
- Spea2: the basic SPEA2 algorithm, that is used throughout the COLE framework
  as the genetic algorithm of choice
